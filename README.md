# Water Sort
**Solving the Water Sort game**

This project had many goals:
* not only am I "solving" a "problem,"
* I'm doing a "public" comparison of various programming languages
  * for my own benefit, for reference
  * for 'education' and sharing

See [the Go ReadMe](go/README.md) for a link to the game/app in the App Store

<kbd>Go</kbd> was the first language; I'm listing my project thus:

1. Java next -- for a couple of reasons, primarily to exercise something of what I already know, there
2. Python, after that -- for "simplicity"*
3. C++, or maybe another that I know
4. [Clojure](https://clojure.org/) (and/or Common Lisp)...
5. maybe [Switft](https://www.swift.org/)
here, the order may change, but options include:
* [Groovy](https://groovy-lang.org/)
* Haskell, or OCaml ...
* [Grain](https://grain-lang.org/), because I want to learn that -- it compiles to [WASM](https://webassembly.org/)
* [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)
* [Julia](https://julialang.org/)
* SmallTalk ([Squeak](https://squeak.org/))

... the [possibilities]((https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_programming_languages)) are [endless](https://medium.com/web-development-zone/a-complete-list-of-computer-programming-languages-1d8bc5a891f)
